### Steps for Conducting a A/B Testing experiment:
1. Hypothesis and Requirements: What is your hypthesis, what are you improving and why?
2. Test and Control: setup the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) - a conversion rate which is a baseline for the minimum improvement you want your feature to enhance.
3. Success Metric: A conversion rate that should reflect in your KPI of increasing your ROI or growth.
4. Timelines : Establish a timeline for this experiment or hypothesis.
5. Sample: Setup sample size with enough randomness and for a group experiment, of equal sizes.
6. Build: Build the feature/product
7. Results: Analyse and make decisions on usefulness and possible improvements.
