Self Guide to Machine Learning

## Machine Learning
A lot of definitions can be found online, the one I like best is computers learning to improve with experience(data).

## Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning: A dependent variable is predicted based on a set of independent variables by generating a function to map inputs to outputs. Examples: Random Forest, kNN, Logistic Regression
2. Unsupervised Learning: Forms groups (also known as clusters) of data, no target or outcome variables. Examples: k-means algorithm
3. Semi-supervised Learning: Training data includes some desired outputs (labeled data) and a larger amount of unlabeled data.
4. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm trains to make some specific decisions, using trial and error.


## Regression Predictive Modeling
Regression consists of algorithms predicting a continuous outcome variable (also known as dependent variable) based on one or multiple predictor variables (also known as independent variables).
Any time we need to predict a *continuous numerical value*, we use regression algorithms. Examples: Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forests

### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a *linear* relationship between a dependent and an independent variable, represented by the linear equation:
```sh
y = ax + b
```
where x is the independent variable and y the dependent variable



## Classification Predictive Modeling 
Classification consists of algorithms predicting a discrete output variable(s) (labels/categories) so the mapping function predicts the labels for any given test observation. Examples: kNN, K-means clustering, Logistic Regression

### Logistic Regression

### Random Forests
